This is a fun experiment I did to see how to generate a random password based on a few different variables.
This uses mouse movement, pseudo-random times, and computer speed to generate a lot of garbage, then turn that garbage into
characters for use as a quick password. 

It is not to generate permanent passwords, but can be useful in generating a password which is one time use.
